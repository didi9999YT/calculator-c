# My calculator made in C++
Welcome to my calculator made in C ++.

This calculator took some time to be made because I'm a bit of a beginner in this type of language and so it may also be that there are some errors and bugs.
This calculator was essentially made to run on a command line, but later I will add a graphical interface but only later!
I hope you like this calculator!

WARNING: The windows version is not yet fully completed, but you can leave the release window on my Github page.
